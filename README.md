This project is a complete UI clone of the Binance website, focusing on design replication, responsiveness, and modern component-based architecture.
It helps beginners and developers understand complex UI layouts used in real-world financial and crypto platforms.

No real transactions, authentication, or trading occurs — all features are mocked or static.
